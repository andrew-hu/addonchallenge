# Addon Challenge

This repository will include addons created everyday for 30 days. In each folder, the README file will briefly explain what was accomplished and the important points learned when creating each addon. 

The initial few addons will be simple introductory exercises to warm up to importing Blizzard's templates/assets, creating basic widgets, and interacting with in-game events. Our goal is to  build up to make more useful addons with more complexity as the month progresses.
